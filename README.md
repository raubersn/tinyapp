# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). In essence, a URL Shortener is a service that takes a regular URL and transforms it into an encoded version, which redirects back to the original URL.

- Creates a new URL using the provided request body
- Redirects to a route where the new URL can be viewed

#### GET /urls/:id

- Retrieves the URL with the specified id
- Renders a representation of the URL
- Responds with a 404 - Not Found error if the URL doesn't exist

#### PUT /urls/:id

- Updates a specific URL using the provided request body
- Redirects to a route where the updated URL can be viewed
- Responds with a 404 - Not Found error if the User doesn't exist

#### DELETE /urls/:id

- Deletes a specific URL
- Redirect to the index of the collection
- Responds with a 404 - Not Found error if the User doesn't exist
